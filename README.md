# React To-Do App (Basic)

This app is my initial attempt at a basic to-do list, with the capabilities to add and remove items from the list, as well as clearing the list of all items. So far, the bones have been set out for all the basic elements and features, bt I am still configuring the add and remove button functionality. 

Upon completion of this project, I am looking to use this as a template to then create a backend database to store the list in, and my current brainstorms include:
-Creating feature to store multiple lists that the user can switch between and add/remove from.
-Create login so different users see different lists and anyone not logged in won't see other lists and their lists won't be saved.
