# React To-Do App (Basic)

This app is my initial attempt at a basic to-do list. Functionalities included in the app allow the user to add new items to the todo list and remove old ones, as well as fully clear the list.

##Remaining objectives:
-Create backend database to store list entries so that the list doesn't disappear with every refresh.

##Possible additions to the app (brainstorming):
-Editing feature to change list items without needing to delete the entire entry.
-Creating feature to store multiple lists that the user can switch between and add/remove from.
-Create login so different users see different lists and anyone not logged in won't see other lists and their lists won't be saved.
